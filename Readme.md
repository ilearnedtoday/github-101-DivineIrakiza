GIT & GIT HUB
Git is distributed Version Control System (VCS), 
which means it is a useful tool for easily tracking changes to your code, collaborating, and sharing.
ADVANTAGES OF GIT
1. track the changes you make to your project so you always have a record of what you‚Äôve worked on
 and can easily revert back to an older version if need be
2. makes working with others easier‚Äîgroups of people can work together 
on the same project and merge their changes into one final source!

A repository is where your project work happens(moreof a project folder)

When a repository is created with GitHub, it‚Äôs stored remotely in the ‚òÅÔ∏è.
You can clone a repository to create a local copy on your computer and then use Git to sync the two. 

Committing and pushing are how you can add the changes you made on your local machine to the remote repository in GitHub.

Committing and pushing may feel new at first, but we promise you‚Äôll get used to it üôÇ(who is "we?")
your "GitHub dashboard" helps to easily navigate to your repositories and see useful information about them.
 Make sure you‚Äôre logged in to see it!

the  README file can be added to your repository to;
1.tell other people why your project is useful, 
2.what they can do with your project
3.and how they can use it

BRANCHES
used to isolate work that you do not want merged into your final project just yet.
Branches allow you to;
1. develop features, 
2.fix bugs, 
3. safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository

FORKS
A fork is another way to copy a repository, but is usually used when you want to contribute to someone else‚Äôs project.
